🧪 How It Works (JavaScript Overview)

Auth Object

Handles login, signup, logout

Stores users in localStorage

Updates UI based on auth state

Page Transitions

JavaScript adds .active class

CSS handles animation timing (2.6s)

Navigation happens after animation completes

Animations

CSS handles visuals

JavaScript only triggers states

Clean separation of logic & UI

🎯 Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates:

Strong understanding of DOM manipulation

Clean separation of logic, styling, and structure

Real-world frontend patterns without frameworks

Advanced CSS animations and SVG handling

📝 Future Improvements

Backend authentication

Database integration

User progress sync

Admin panel for content management
